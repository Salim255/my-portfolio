      <h2> ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p class="header-text">
          My journey in web development began in 2019, following my studies
          in mathematics and IT, which provided me with a strong foundation in problem-solving. <br>
          <span>
            Fast-forward to today, Iâ€™ve gained practical experience in both the modeling and development
            of databases and applications. <br>
          </span>

          <span>
            I'm always eager to continue learning and tackling new challenges in web development.
